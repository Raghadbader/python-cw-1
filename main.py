# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print("raghad")
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(5+3)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(10/2)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
print(10*2)
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
length=5
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
width=3
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
area=length * width
print(f"the result {area}")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"lf the length of the rectangle is {length}, and width is {width}, then the area is 15")
